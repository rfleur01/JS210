/* Was the result what you expected? The tricky parts here are the names of the properties, 
the variable name, and, of course, the fact that you can use an expression to create 
and access properties. The difference between lines 11 and 12, although they may look 
the same, is that on line 11, the value of prop2 (the string '456') is used as the key. 
This line does not log undefined because a property with the name of '456' and a value 
of '678' was added to myObject on line 9 using the prop2 variable. On line 12, when 
the 'prop2' (string literal) property of myObject is accessed, the value logged ('456')
is different from the value assigned on line 3 ('234') because this property was reassigned 
on line 8. */
